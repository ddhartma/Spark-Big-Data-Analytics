# Spark
How to deal with ***Big Data***?

Why Learn Spark?
Spark is currently one of the most popular tools for big data analytics. You might have heard of other tools such as Hadoop. Hadoop is a slightly older technology although still in use by some companies. Spark is generally faster than Hadoop, which is why Spark has become more popular over the last few years.

There are many other big data tools and systems, each with its own use case. For example, there are database system like Apache Cassandra and SQL query engines like Presto. But Spark is still one of the most popular tools for analyzing large data sets.

Here is an outline of the topics we are covering in this lesson:


Review of the hardware behind big data
Introduction to distributed systems
Brief history of Spark and big data
Common Spark use cases
Other technologies in the big data ecosystem

## Setup Instructions <a name="Setup_Instructions"></a>
The following is a brief set of instructions on setting up a cloned repository.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites: Installation of Python via Anaconda and Command Line Interaface <a name="Prerequisites"></a>
- Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Install Python 3.7 - 64 Bit
- If you need a Command Line Interface (CLI) under Windows you could use [git](https://git-scm.com/). Under Mac OS use the pre-installed Terminal.

- Upgrade Anaconda via
```
$ conda upgrade conda
$ conda upgrade --all
```

- Optional: In case of trouble add Anaconda to your system path. Write in your CLI
```
$ export PATH="/path/to/anaconda/bin:$PATH"
```

### Clone the project <a name="Clone_the_project"></a>
- Open your Command Line Interface
- Change Directory to your project older, e.g. `cd my_github_projects`
- Clone the Github Project inside this folder with Git Bash (Terminal) via:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ddhartma/Recommendation-Engines.git
```

- Change Directory
```
$ cd Recommendation-Engines
```

- Create a new Python environment, e.g. rec_eng. Inside Git Bash (Terminal) write:
```
$ conda create --name rec_eng
```

- Activate the installed environment via
```
$ conda activate rec_eng
```

- Install the following packages (via pip or conda)
```
numpy = 1.17.4
pandas = 0.24.2
```

- Check the environment installation via
```
$ conda env list
```
